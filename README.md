# Railgorithms

Train companies aim to find the most efficient routes to cover all the stations and connections.
With our program we implemented multiple algorithms to come up with a good solution.
To come up with a good solution most connections have to be included in the routes of the trains.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This code base is written in Python 3.8.3 and up.
Other requirements such as packages, can be installed by entering the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using conda:

```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Usage

You can run the program using:

```
python3 main.py
```

You will be guided through the process of picking an algorithm by questions in the terminal.

### Structure

The following list provides the most important directories and files:

- **/code**: contains alle the code for this project
  - **/code/README.md**: explanation of the algorithms
  - **/code/algorithms**: code for the algorithms
  - **/code/classes**: classes used in this project
  - **/code/visualisation**: code for the data visualization
- **/data**: contains all the data files
  - **/data/README.md**: explains the different types of data
  - **/data/Holland**: data for the provinces North and South Holland
  - **/data/Nationaal**: data for the whole country
- **/docs**: contains all the documentation like an UML diagram
- **/results**: folder where the results appear after you run  the program
  - **/results/README.md**: explains the different kinds of output
