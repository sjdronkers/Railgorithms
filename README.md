# Railgorithms

Train companies are always looking to find the most efficient trajectories to cover all the stations and railways. With our program we are going to use two algorithms to come up with different solutions. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This code base is written in Python 3.8.3 and up. Other requirements such as paackages, can be installed by entering the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

You can run the program using:
```
python3 main.py
```

### Structure

The following list provides the most important directories and files:

- **/code**: contains alle the code for this project
  - **/code/algorithms**: code for the algorithms
  - **/code/classes**: classes used in this project
  - **/code/visualisation**: code for the data visualization
- **/data**: contains all the data files
